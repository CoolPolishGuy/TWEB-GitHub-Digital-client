            <h1 style="font-size: 55px;">What is a Cryptocurrency?</h1>
            <p>Cryptocurrency is a form of digital money that is designed to be secure and, in many cases, anonymous. It is
                a currency associated with the internet that uses cryptography, the process of converting legible information
                into an almost uncrackable code, to track purchases and transfers. Cryptography was born out of the need
                for secure communication in the Second World War. It has evolved in the digital era with elements of mathematical
                theory and computer science to become a way to secure communications, information and money online.
                <br> In other words we can reduce it to a simple definition, you find it to be just limited entries in a database
                no one can change without fulfilling specific conditions and this may seem ordinary and simple, but, believe
                it or not: this is exactly how you can define a currency.
                <br>
                <br>Bitcoin is the first decentralized digital currency. Bitcoins are digital coins you can send trough the internet,
                compared to other alternatives they have a number of advantages:
                <br>
                <ol>
                    <li>They are transferred directly from person to person via the net without going through a bank or a clearingouse.
                        It reduces the fee</li>
                    <li>You can use them in every country</li>
                    <li>Your account cannot be froze</li>
                    <li>There are no prerequisites or arbritary limits</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="data/doge_mine.gif" width="480" height="270" class="giphy-embed" align="right"></img>
                Bitcoin mining is the process by which transactions are verified and added to the public ledger, known as the block chain,
                and also the means through which new bitcoin are released. During mining, your computer performs cryptographic
                hashes (two successive SHA256s) on what is called a block header. Because the target is a cumbersome number
                with a lot of numbers, a simpler number is usually used to express the current target.
                <br/>
                <br/>This number is called the mining difficulty. The difficulty of mining is calculated by comparing how difficult
                it is to generate a block compared to the first block created. This means that a difficulty of 70000 is equivalent
                to 70000 times more effort than necessary for Satoshi Nakamoto to generate the first block.
                <br/>
                <br/>At the time when the mining was much slower and poorly optimized. The difficulty changes every block. The
                network is trying to assign the difficulty so that the global computing power takes exactly 14 days to generate
                2016 blocks. This is why the difficulty increases with the power of the network. In general the participant
                who first solves the puzzle gets to place the next block on the block chain and claim the rewards. The rewards,
                which incentivize mining, are both the transaction fees associated with the transactions compiled in the
                block as well as newly released bitcoin.

            </p>
            <p>

                <b>Bitcoin</b> was created in 2009: A software developer called Satoshi Nakamoto proposed bitcoin, which was
                an electronic payment system based on mathematical proof. The idea was to produce a currency independent
                of any central authority, transferable electronically, more or less instantly, with very low transaction
                fees.
            </p>
            <P>
                Nowadays, there are many more like:
            </P>
            <p>
                <b>Litecoin 2011:</b>
                <br> Provides fast, 2.5 minute transaction confirmations and uses scrypt-based proof-of-work to target everyday
                computers. Litecoin, created by an ex-Google employee, Charlie lee, is often considered the silver to Bitcoin's
                gold.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Ripple 2012:</b>
                <br> Real-time peer-to-peer settlement network. Ripples aren't mined and each transaction destroys a small amount
                of XRP. The net effect is a delfationary asset.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>DASH 2014:</b>
                <br> Aims to be a privacy-centric cryptographic currency with unlinkable transactions using the PrivateSend system.
                Blockchain governance is carried out via the MasterNode system.
            </p>

            <p>
                Playing a bit with the graph above. We can see that prices in 2017 have literally exploded. We strongly felt the infatuation
                by investors for cryptocurrencies. Crypto-currencies are becoming more widespread around the world while
                Internet payments are accepted by many companies. Crypto-currencies are changing the payment and investment
                assets, just as the way people invest in gold, silver, market shares, real estate, mutual funds These days.
                More and more investors are interested in investing money on these crypto-currencies in 2017 and will be
                more in 2018. With the increased demand for crypto-currencies its prices have greatly increased.

                <img src="data/doge_trend.gif" width="440" height="270" class="giphy-embed" align="left"></img>Why has the bitcoin price risen so fast in the last month ( 11.2017) . Bitcoin is a very unpredictable
                cryptocurrency but there are some factore that we know are contributing to that climb.
                <br> As the Bitcoin reaches 2000$ a trend of investors is rising and clamoring for crypto-currency of all sorts.
                Only a few years back digital money was seen as the province of cranks and computers geeks, it has now become
                so mainstream that investors see it as a new asset and are creating hundred million dollar hedge funds to
                acquire it.
                <br>
                <br> That kind of behaviour was unimaginable a couple of years ago. Other people see digital currencies as an
                asset like gold, which can hold its value even with a instability of a government. Recent political reveals
                in Brazil and the United States, which led to drops in the dollar and the brazilian currency, may have contributed
                to the recent uptick in bitcoin buying.Finally, bitcoin may be gaining indirectly from a recent explosion
                in the value of other digital currencies like for example Ethereum and Litecoin. As it is possible to buy
                these currencies with dollars or other traditional currencies, it's often simpler or more convienent to use
                bitcoins to buy them.
                <br>
                <br>So to say that there is likely chance that more people may be buying bitcoin as transferring currency in
                order to acquire other less known cryptocurrencies This year in Japan where the bitcoin has been born, new
                rules has been brought where the new currency is being treated inside the banking system In asia , mostly
                china has become more permissive for using bitcoin as currency for exchanges between U.S and China. This
                also a key factor in the bitcoin related investment that are leading of the price increase</p>

            <h1>Comparaison between CryptoCurrency &#38 standard stock </h1>
            <p>
                On the graph below we have the stock prices of the four most prominent IT companies in the world ( Microsoft, Amazon, IBM
                and Apple) between 2000 and 2010. We can firstly admit that they have been more consistent and less fluctuating
                that the cryptocurrency. That is due to that the fact that their structure is very different and more stable.
                Theses companies have built their reputation over many years and have earned people's trust. Apple’s stock
                is the one which had the most visible increase during that time because of the success of their product which
                inspired people and the way they saw the digital world They have suffered during the crisis of 2008 which
                caused many people to lose faith in the market. But gladly for these companies computers and phones were
                always in high demand and therefore had no problem to regain their potential and their stock prices

            </p>

            <div id="chart2" style="text-align: center"></div>

            <p>
                It is time to have a look at the stocks of the compagnies like Google,Apple,Facebook and Amazon which are the most influencal
                compagnies in the world as of now. In the following graph you will see the average price of the stocks combined
                between the 4 compagnies that we named before and the four most know crypto-currencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum
                , Dash and litecoin).

            <!-- 1er GRAPHIQUE ICI -->
            <p>When you decided to play in the trading Market with your money , you have to expect some volatility regardless
                of the investment stock you choose. Both bitcoin and stock market has seen some wild swings during their
                period of existence. Volatility is not necessarily a bad omen, however. A market without ANY volatility is
                stale and boring, and even more importantly, not profitable.
                <br> In reality we know that a high volatility yields towards high profits or high losses. The key point is positioning
                yourself on the ride side of the slope to benefit even when others are feeling the pain. In theory it is
                easier with cryptocurrency than with stocks. In order to make an educated decision in the stock market, you
                have to take into account many factors so that your decision will be the most accurate such as. PE ratios,
                52 week high/low, 50 day moving average, 200 day moving average, dividends, and many others. All of them
                must be analyzed in order to find the best choice for your hard earned buck. Bitcoin, on the other hand,
                continually ignores technical indicators and does what it wants. Gadly what Bitcoin wants is to climb higher.
            </p>
            <div id="pie" style="text-align: center"></div>
            <p> They have been many bad news for the cryptocurrencies during the middle of the year such a ban from china for
                all the ic’s and ban all the exchanges in bitcoins all of this, the crypto market has been markedly resilient.
                Playing with the graphic above shows us that after the middle of the 2016 year the average price of the cryptocurrency
                has gone higher than the GAFA compagnies. All the facts that we explained so far are a direct cause of such
                an increase. The mining community has gone so large that the creation of the volume has incresead and therefore
                the use of it.

    <div class="red" id="ico">
        <section>
            <h1 style="font-size: 55px;">And now let's talk about new ICO</h1>
            <p>
                ICOs are similar to IPOs and crowdfunding. Like IPOs, a stake of the startup or company is sold to raise money for the entity’s
                operations during an ICO operation. However, while IPOs deal with investors, ICOs deal with supporters that
                are keen to invest in a new project much like a crowdfunding event. But ICOs differ from crowdfunding in
                that the backers of the former are motivated by a prospective return in their investments (ROI), while the funds
                raised in the latter campaign are basically donations. For these reasons, ICOs are referred to as crowdsales.
                <br>
                <br> Ethereum is one of the most know ICO. In 2014 it raising 3,700 BTC in its first 12 hours, equal to approximately
                $2.3 million dollars (just for fun the actual value of this amount (01.12.2017) -> $37 million).
                <br>
                <br>In this Wild West investments , no need for a thick form from a bank or green light from the authorities.
                It is enough to present its project on a web site, by specifying the price of the token which one is about
                to emit and the rights, advantage which it provides.
                <br>
                <br> These digital assets are acquired and traded against cryptocurrencies, usually the best known as Ether or
                Bitcoin. But in reality, the value of the issued tokens proves even more unstable than during a traditional
                IPO. It's like the gambling inside a casino.
                <br>
                <br> Many ICOs see their price drop 80% or 90% but can rise sharply when the project starts delivering its first
                content. While some projects struggle to get started, others appear doubtful from the start. Let’s take a
                situation that could potentially happen, after the fundraising, no news from the trading platforms. Nobody
                answers and we have no chance to see our money again.
                <br>
                <br>While the fake ICOs are multiplied on the net and their campaigns is becoming more and more visible, the
                main financial regulators increased the warnings. Notably with China and South Korea who have totally banned
                the creation of ICO on their territory since mid-September.
                <br>
                <br>The following graph illustrates well the phenomenon. Each circle represents a completed ICO. The radius represents
                the percentage of return on investment and the color defined if it is positive (green), negative (red) and
                if there is no color there is no return on investments. The abscissa represents the time as for the ordinate
                indicates the price of the ICO in mid-November.

            </p>


            <!-- 3e GRAPHIQUE ICI: taille = ROI et vert ou rouge dépends de la perte ou du gain -->
            <div id="icojs" style="text-align: center"></div>

            <p>
                This graph shows several correlations. Indeed, we can notice a sharp increase in the number of ICO from June 2017 exactly
                at the same time or the average Cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, Litecoin) have exceeded the average
                shares of large companies present in the GAFA (see stock vs crypto gaphic). 
                <br><br>
                <img src="data/doge_fight.gif" width="440" height="270" class="giphy-embed" align="right"></img>
                We can say that 2017 has really
                seen the explosion of cryptocurrencies. More and more people are aware of this virtual world and want to
                dive into the investments courtyard. Imagine for a moment to believe Stratis token (big green round) by investing
                a certain amount. A few months later we end up with an ROI of over 48000%. Who would not dream about that
                phenomen? 
                <br><br>
                As time goes by we see more negative ROIs appear. It can be assumed that partners have no idea
                what to think with the growing number of ICOs. The various warnings emited by the authorities could also
                calm the ardor of the invertors.
